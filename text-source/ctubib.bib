@book{Stephan2007,
  abstract = {In just a few years, service-oriented architectures (SOA) and Web services not only gained considerable interest in computer science research, they were also taken up with unanimity by all major international players in the IT industry. However, and in spite of all existing standards, in most SOA applications much human intervention is still required, for example to interpret the semantics of informal descriptions or to harmonize incompatible data schemata. Semantic Web services combine Web services communication technology with the intelligent processing of ontology-based metadata to achieve highly integrated enterprise application integration scenarios, for service look-up, schema matching, or protocol negotiation, for example. Rudi Studer and his team deliver a self-contained compendium about this exciting field, starting with the basic standards and technologies and also including advanced applications in eGovernment and eHealth. The contributions provide both the theoretical background and the practical knowledge necessary to understand the essential ideas and to design new cutting-edge applications. They address computer science students as well as researchers in academia and industry who need a concise introduction and state-of-the-art survey of current research, and the book can easily be used as the basis of a specialized course on Web services or Semantic Web applications. In addition, IT professionals will be able to assess the potential and possible benefits of this new technology.},

@phdthesis{Guizzardi2005,
title = "Ontological foundations for structural conceptual models",
abstract = "The main objective of this thesis is to contribute to the theory of Conceptual Modeling by proposing ontological foundations for structural conceptual models. Conceptual Modeling is a discipline of great importance to several areas in Computer Science. Its main objective is concerned with identifying, analyzing and describing the essential concepts and constraints of a universe of discourse, with the help of a (diagrammatic) modeling language that is based on a set of basic modeling concepts (forming a metamodel). In this thesis, we show how conceptual modeling languages can be evaluated and (re)designed with the purpose of improving their ontological adequacy. In simple terms, ontological adequacy is a measure of how close the models produced using a modeling language are to the situations in the reality they are supposed to represent. The thesis starts by proposing a systematic evaluation method for comparing a metamodel of the concepts underlying a language to a reference ontology of the corresponding domain in reality. The focus of this thesis is on general conceptual modeling languages (as opposed to domain specific ones). Hence, the proposed reference ontology is a foundational (or upper-level) ontology. Moreover, since, it focuses on structural modeling aspects (as opposed to dynamic ones), this foundational ontology is an ontology of objects, their properties and relations, their parts, the roles they play, and the types they instantiate. The proposed ontology was developed by adapting and extending a number of theories coming, primarily, from formal ontology in philosophy, but also from cognitive science and linguistics. Once developed, every subtheory of the ontology is used in the creation of methodological tools (e.g., modeling profiles, guidelines and design patterns). The expressiveness and relevance of these tools are shown throughout the thesis to solve some classical and recurrent conceptual modeling problems. Finally, the thesis demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of both the method and the proposed ontology by analyzing and extending a fragment of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) which deals with the construction of structural conceptual models.",

DOLCE is presented here in an intuitive way; the reader should refer to the project deliverable for a detailed axiomatization. A comparison with WordNet's top-level taxonomy of nouns is also provided, which shows how DOLCE, used in addition to the OntoClean methodology, helps isolating and understanding some major WordNet's semantic limitations. We suggest that such analysis could hopefully lead to an ``ontologically sweetened'' WordNet, meant to be conceptually more rigorous, cognitively transparent, and efficiently exploitable in several applications.",
